# Core NetWars Tournament 6

### GOLDEN TICKET

#### Greetings to you , the lucky finder of this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka!
I shake you warmly by the hand! Tremendous things are in store for you! Many wonderful surprises await you! For now, I do invite you to come to my factory and be my guest for two evenings - you and all others who are lucky enough to nd my Golden Tickets. I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself, showing you everything that there is to see.

I am preparing other surprises that are even more marvelous and more fantastic for you and for all my beloved Golden Ticket holders - mystic and marvelous surprises that will entrance, delight, intrigue, astonish, and perplex you beyond measure!

Present this ticket at the factory gates at six thirty in the evening of the rst day of NetWars. Don't be late! And you are allowed to bring with you members of your team to look after each other and to ensure that you don't get into mischief. One more thing - be certain to have your conference badge with you, otherwise you will not be admitted.

(Signed) Willy Wonka


## Objective: WW - A Golden Ticket 

**Q1 - I GOT A GOLDEN TICKET**

What user account are you automatically logged into in the provided virtual machine?


**A1 - 'contestwinner'**
```
contestwinner@oompa-loompa:~$  whoami
contestwinner

What's the host name of your workstation?


**A2 - 'oompa-loompa'**
```
contestwinner@oompa-loompa:~$ hostname
oompa-loompa
```


**Q3 - AN ODD PATH**

When a user enters a command into a Windows command prompt or a Linux terminal, the operating system checks for commands and programs of that name in the environment “path” . The $PATH / %PATH% variable tells the OS where to look for the command entered.
Your system has something odd in its path. What is it?
