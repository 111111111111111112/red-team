#### WordPress

#### Manual Tricks
If 443 is open check the certificate for alternative Virtual hosts that the cert may work on.
If you find that the certificate is good for multiple subdomains/virtual hosts add them to your host file with the following command.
```
$ vi /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1         localhost
127.0.0.2         kali
10.10.10.123      www.example.com
```
# Privilege Escalation

### Windows
First lets check system info with the folloing commands.
```
C:\Users\user\Desktop> systeminfo
```
msf exploit checker:
```
msf exploit > use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
msf exploit > set SESSION 1
msf exploit > run
```
### Linux
First steps to go from low-privilege user to root on a linux box.

Start a python http server to transfer files to the compromised machine. Note that this command will host files in your current directory, so make sure you copy all files before running the python SimpleHTTPServer.
```
$ sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
