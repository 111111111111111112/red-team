# Intelligence Gathering

The information-gathering phase of our network pentesting methodology consists of service enumeration, network mapping, banner reconnaissance and more. Host and service discovery efforts result in a compiled list of all accessible systems and their respective services with the goal of obtaining as much information about the systems as possible.

Host and service discovery includes initial domain footprinting, live host detection, service enumeration, and operating system and application fingerprinting. The purpose of this step is to collectively map the in-scope environment and prepare for threat identification.
