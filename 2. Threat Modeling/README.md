# Threat Modeling

With the information collected from the previous step, security testing transitions to identifying vulnerabilities within systems. This begins with automated scans initially but quickly develops into deep-dive manual testing techniques. During the threat-modeling step, assets are identified and categorized into threat categories. These may involve: sensitive documents, trade secrets, financial information but more commonly consist of technical information found during the previous phase.
